# Java-Exercises

Directory for Java exercises as I review the book. The book? "Java for Everyone" Second Edition, authored by Cay Horstmann. Not all  programming exercises listed in the book are completed here.

This also contains other Java skills development exercises from places like Codecademy or Project Euler. 

Be forewarned: many exercises are not commented nor documented. Those that *are*, however, tend to be the better ones. In my opinion, anyway.
