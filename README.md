# Java-Textbook-Exercises
Directory for Java exercises as I review the entire book. The book in question is "Java for Everyone" Second Edition. 

I will not be doing all the programming exercises, mainly skipping over the overly-basic ones from the early chapters.

Not all programs are commented or documented. Those that are, however, tend to be the better ones. Be forewarned!
