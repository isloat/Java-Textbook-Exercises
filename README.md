# Java-Exercises

Directory for Java exercises as I review the book. The book? "Java for Everyone" Second Edition, authored by Cay Horstmann. Not all  programming exercises listed in the book are completed here.

Be forewarned: many exercises are not commented nor documented. Those that *are*, however, tend to be the better ones. In my opinion, anyway.
